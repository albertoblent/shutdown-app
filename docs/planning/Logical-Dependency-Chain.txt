ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES

Atomic Features:
- Each feature works independently
- No feature breaks existing functionality
- Features enhance but don't require each other

Progressive Enhancement:
- Static → Dynamic
- Online → Offline
- Simple → Smart
- Text → Visual

Data Model Stability:
- Core tables defined early
- Only extend, never modify
- Migrations planned from start

User Value Checkpoints:
- Step 7: First working routine
- Step 11: Progress tracking
- Step 14: Delightful experience
- Step 17: Efficiency maximized

ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

Don't Build:
- User preferences before core loop
- Themes before functionality  
- Social features before personal
- Analytics before data collection
- Optimizations before usage patterns

Dependency Violations:
- No AI features until manual works perfectly
- No team features until individual is solid
- No integrations until core is stable
- No native apps until PWA is proven

PARALLEL WORK STREAMS

Can Build Simultaneously:
- Frontend shell + Backend auth
- Database schema + API design
- UI components + Data models
- Offline capability + Online sync

Must Serialize:
- Data model → CRUD operations
- Basic UI → Enhanced UI
- Manual entry → Automation
- Individual → Team features
