SHUTDOWN ROUTINE APP - RISKS AND MITIGATIONS

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES

Risk: Offline/Online Sync Conflicts
- Users complete habits offline and online simultaneously
- Data conflicts when syncing
- Lost data frustrates users and breaks streaks
Mitigation:
- Implement "last write wins" with full history log
- Show sync status clearly in UI
- Allow manual conflict resolution for critical data
- Store complete action history for recovery

Risk: 2-Minute Performance Target
- Database queries slow down with months of data
- UI becomes sluggish with many habits
- Network latency impacts perceived speed
Mitigation:
- Implement aggressive caching strategy from day 1
- Paginate historical data queries
- Preload today's data on app launch
- Use optimistic UI updates everywhere
- Design data model for time-series efficiency

Risk: PWA Limitations
- iOS PWA restrictions (no push notifications)
- Storage limits on mobile browsers
- Inconsistent offline behavior across devices
Mitigation:
- Build notification fallbacks (SMS, email)
- Implement data pruning for old entries
- Test on all major platforms early
- Consider native app timeline acceleration
- Document platform limitations clearly

Risk: Data Model Lock-in
- Early schema decisions hard to change
- Migration complexity grows over time
- Breaking changes frustrate users
Mitigation:
- Design extensible schema with JSONB fields
- Version API from day 1
- Build migration framework before launch
- Keep core tables minimal
- Plan for backward compatibility

MVP SCOPING RISKS

Risk: Feature Creep in MVP
- "Just one more feature" syndrome
- MVP becomes too complex to ship
- Loses focus on core value prop
Mitigation:
- Hard limit: 7 features maximum in MVP
- Define "done" criteria for each feature
- Time-box MVP development
- User test with paper prototypes first
- Kill features that take >2 days

Risk: MVP Too Minimal
- Doesn't demonstrate core value
- Users don't understand the vision
- No clear upgrade path
Mitigation:
- Focus on complete user journey, not features
- Ensure first-run experience is polished
- Include one "delight" feature (completion ritual)
- Build extensibility hooks from start
- Test with 5 real users before expanding

Risk: Wrong Initial Assumptions
- Users want different features than expected
- Core concept doesn't resonate
- Usage patterns differ from hypothesis
Mitigation:
- Launch closed beta with 20 users
- Implement analytics from day 1
- Weekly user interviews during beta
- A/B test core assumptions
- Pivot quickly based on data

Risk: Architecture Doesn't Scale
- MVP choices block future features
- Refactoring requires full rewrite
- Performance degrades with growth
Mitigation:
- Use proven patterns (PWA, REST/GraphQL)
- Implement monitoring early
- Load test with 10x expected data
- Design for horizontal scaling
- Keep services loosely coupled

RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

Risk: Solo Developer Burnout
- Too much to build alone
- Context switching overhead
- Motivation loss during long build
Mitigation:
- Strict work-in-progress limits
- Automate everything possible
- Use component libraries (don't reinvent)
- Schedule regular breaks
- Ship something every week

Risk: Limited Testing Resources
- No QA team
- Multiple platforms to support
- Edge cases multiply quickly
Mitigation:
- Implement comprehensive automated testing
- Use error tracking (Sentry) from day 1
- Beta test with tech-savvy users first
- Focus on one platform initially
- Crowdsource bug reports

Risk: Infrastructure Costs
- Database hosting expenses
- Notification services add up
- CDN and bandwidth costs
Mitigation:
- Start with free tiers (Supabase, Vercel)
- Implement usage quotas early
- Cache aggressively to reduce queries
- Consider freemium model planning
- Monitor costs weekly

Risk: Time to Market
- Competitors could launch first
- User interest might wane
- Perfect becomes enemy of good
Mitigation:
- Launch MVP in 30 days max
- Build in public for accountability
- Share progress updates weekly
- Focus on one unique differentiator
- Fast follow with updates

Risk: Knowledge Gaps
- PWA development learning curve
- State management complexity
- Performance optimization expertise
Mitigation:
- Use well-documented frameworks
- Start with tutorials/templates
- Join relevant Discord communities
- Hire freelancer for specific challenges
- Build proof-of-concepts first

Risk: User Acquisition
- Building doesn't guarantee users
- Marketing requires different skills
- Organic growth is slow
Mitigation:
- Build email list during development
- Partner with productivity influencers
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Create compelling demo video
- Solve your own problem first

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

Non-Negotiable Requirements:
1. Page loads in <1 second
2. Daily routine takes <2 minutes
3. Works offline from day 1
4. Zero data loss scenarios
5. Streak recovery options

Early Warning Signals:
- Daily active usage <60% after week 1
- Completion time >3 minutes average
- More than 2 crash reports per week
- User requests focus on missing basics
- Sync conflicts reported by >1% users

Go/No-Go Criteria for Expansion:
- 100+ daily active users
- 70%+ week-2 retention
- <2 minute average completion
- Positive unit economics
- Clear feature request patterns
