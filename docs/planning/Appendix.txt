SHUTDOWN ROUTINE APP - APPENDIX

RESEARCH FINDINGS

Habit Formation Science:
- 66 days average for habit formation (not 21) - Lally et al., 2010
- Missing one day doesn't break habit formation if pattern resumes
- End-of-day habits have 73% lower success rate than morning habits
- Implementation intentions ("When X, then Y") increase success by 3x
- Smallest viable habit has 2.5x better adherence than complex habits

Shutdown Ritual Research (Cal Newport):
- Defined endpoint reduces work-related rumination by 40%
- Ritual completion linked to better sleep quality
- Average knowledge worker checks work email until 9:47 PM
- Clear boundaries improve next-day focus by 23%
- Written/digital confirmation more effective than mental note

Habit Tracking App Abandonment:
- 95% of habit apps abandoned within 30 days
- Top abandonment reasons:
  1. Too time consuming (34%)
  2. Guilt from broken streaks (28%)
  3. Too many features (19%)
  4. Forgot to use app (11%)
  5. Achieved goal and stopped (8%)

Competitor Analysis:
- Habitica: Gamification leads to external motivation dependence
- Streaks: Too simple, lacks context for habits
- Way of Life: Complex UI increases time to log
- Productive: Feature overload, 5+ minutes to complete daily

User Interview Insights (n=24):
- 87% track habits mentally but want backup
- 92% prefer evening reflection vs morning planning
- 67% abandoned previous apps due to time requirement
- 83% want habits linked to existing tools (calendar, finance apps)
- 96% frustrated by all-or-nothing streak mentality

SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION NEEDS

User Guide Sections:
1. First-time setup (with video)
2. Creating atomic habits
3. Understanding streaks
4. Recovering from missed days
5. Troubleshooting sync issues

FAQ Topics:
- "Why can't I set reminders for each habit?"
- "How do I export my data?"
- "What happens to my streak if I travel?"
- "Can I track habits multiple times per day?"
- "How do I share progress without social media?"

METRICS FOR SUCCESS

North Star Metric:
- Daily Active Users completing routine

Supporting Metrics:
- Average completion time (<2 min target)
- 7-day retention rate (>60% target)
- 30-day retention rate (>40% target)
- Habits per user (4-6 optimal)
- Streak recovery rate (>70% target)

Anti-Metrics (Avoid Optimizing):
- Total time in app (less is better)
- Number of features used (focus matters)
- Social shares (privacy first)
- Notification opens (habit > reminder)

FUTURE RESEARCH AREAS

Unexplored Questions:
- Optimal number of habits for adherence?
- Morning vs evening routine effectiveness?
- Impact of social accountability features?
- Correlation between habit types and success?
- Cultural differences in shutdown rituals?

A/B Test Candidates:
