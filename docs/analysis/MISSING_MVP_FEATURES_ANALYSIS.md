## ‚ùå CRITICAL MISSING FEATURES

Based on `docs/planning/Core-Features.txt` (8 core features) and `docs/planning/User-Experience.txt`:

### 1. **SMART SEQUENCING ENGINE** (Core Feature #3)
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING

**What it does:**
- Learns optimal order for habit presentation based on completion patterns
- Groups related habits together (e.g., all finance tasks)
- Places quickest habits first to build momentum
- Adapts based on day-of-week patterns

**Why it's critical:**
- Reduces cognitive load during daily flow
- Builds psychological momentum with quick wins first
- Essential for sub-2-minute completion goal

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Habits display in optimized order based on completion time
- [ ] Related habits are grouped together
- [ ] Quick wins appear first in sequence
- [ ] Manual override option available

### 2. **CONTEXTUAL SHORTCUTS** (Core Feature #4)  
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING

**What it does:**
- One-tap access to apps/websites needed for habit verification
- Deep links to specific app screens
- Quick launchers with return-to-app overlay
- Smart clipboard for value copying

**Why it's critical:**
- Removes friction of app-switching and searching
- Essential for habits requiring verification (budget check, step count, etc.)
- Key to achieving sub-2-minute completion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Habits can have associated app deep links
- [ ] Quick website launchers with return overlay
- [ ] Smart clipboard integration for data copying
- [ ] Seamless flow between apps and shutdown ritual

- Prevents blocking on habits that reveal problems
- Maintains momentum without sacrificing accountability

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Any habit can be flagged for follow-up
- [ ] Optional note field for context
- [ ] Morning notification shows queued items
- [ ] Queue history for follow-through tracking

### 4. **RAPID DATA ENTRY** (Core Feature #7)
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING

**What it does:**
- Voice input for numeric values
- Yesterday's values as quick-tap defaults
- Smart predictions based on patterns
- Gesture shortcuts for common values

**Why it's critical:**
- Every second of friction increases abandonment risk
- Essential for sub-2-minute completion goal
- Multiple input methods ensure speed for all users

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Voice input for numeric habits
- [ ] Yesterday's values shown as quick defaults
- [ ] Pattern-based smart predictions
- [ ] Gesture shortcuts for power users

---

### 5. **MISSED DAY RECOVERY** (User Flow #4)
**Status:** COMPLETELY MISSING

**What it does:**
- Detects missed yesterday completion
- Shows "Yesterday incomplete" banner
- Two options: "Quick catch-up" (30 seconds) OR "Skip & continue"
- Returns user to today's ritual

**Why it's critical:**
- Enables streak recovery without breaking ritual focus
- Prevents spiral effect of missed days
- Maintains present-moment focus while allowing recovery

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Detects incomplete previous day
- [ ] Shows non-intrusive banner notification
- [ ] 30-second catch-up flow
- [ ] Skip option with acknowledgment
- [ ] Returns to today's ritual immediately

## üìã CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

**We have (4 issues):**
- ‚úÖ Issue #4: Core UI Components (may need speed optimization focus)
- ‚úÖ Issue #8: Chain Visualization (simplified) 
- ‚úÖ Issue #9: Completion Ritual
- ‚úÖ Issue #10: Data Export (simplified)

**We're missing (5 core features):**
- ‚ùå Smart Sequencing Engine
- ‚ùå Contextual Shortcuts  
- ‚ùå Action Queue
- ‚ùå Rapid Data Entry
- ‚ùå Missed Day Recovery

## üö® CRITICAL INSIGHT

**We cannot achieve MVP without these 5 missing features.**

The concept's competitive advantage is **sub-2-minute completion** with **minimal friction**. Without Smart Sequencing, Rapid Data Entry, and Contextual Shortcuts, we'll never hit the 2-minute target. Without Action Queue and Missed Day Recovery, users will abandon the app when they encounter blocking situations.

These aren't "nice-to-haves" - they're the **core differentiators** that separate this from generic habit tracking apps.

## üìù RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Create 5 new GitHub issues** for missing core features
2. **Prioritize based on critical path:**
   - Start with Rapid Data Entry (speed foundation)
   - Then Smart Sequencing (psychological flow)
   - Then Action Queue (prevents blocking)
   - Then Missed Day Recovery (user retention)
   - Finally Contextual Shortcuts (advanced optimization)

3. **Review Issue #4** to ensure it focuses on speed optimization for daily interface

**Bottom Line:** Our MVP is currently only 50% complete in terms of core concept features. We need these 5 additional issues to deliver on the original vision.
