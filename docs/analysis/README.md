# Analysis Archive

This directory contains historical architectural decision records and analysis documents that guided the project's development. These serve as precedents for future decision-making and document the systematic approach used to maintain concept integrity.

## Document Index

### `CONCEPT_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md`
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Purpose**: Analysis of all GitHub issues against the original concept philosophy

**Key Outcomes:**
- Issue #7 (Date Navigation) identified as violating core "shutdown ritual" philosophy
- Issue #8 (Streak Calculation) simplified from analytics platform to basic visualization
- Issue #10 (Data Export) simplified from enterprise backup to basic portability
- Established precedent for concept-first feature evaluation

**Why Preserved**: Critical reference for evaluating future features against concept integrity. Shows how to identify and prevent "comprehensive habit tracking platform" drift.

### `MISSING_MVP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md`
**Date**: 2025-01-08  
**Purpose**: Systematic discovery of missing core features from original concept

**Key Outcomes:**
- Identified 5 missing core features from `Core-Features.txt` (50% of MVP scope)
- Created Issues #28-32 for Smart Sequencing, Rapid Data Entry, Action Queue, Missed Day Recovery, and Contextual Shortcuts
- Demonstrated that current scope was only ~50% complete vs original concept requirements
- Established complete MVP feature scope alignment

**Why Preserved**: Documents the discovery process for ensuring complete MVP scope. Shows methodology for comparing current state against original vision systematically.

## Usage Guidelines

**For Future Feature Decisions:**
1. Reference `CONCEPT_ALIGNMENT_ANALYSIS.md` to understand concept evaluation criteria
2. Apply same "shutdown ritual tool vs comprehensive habit tracker" lens
3. Maintain focus on sub-2-minute completion and minimal cognitive load

**For Scope Completeness:**
1. Reference `MISSING_MVP_FEATURES_ANALYSIS.md` for systematic scope review methodology
2. Compare any major milestone against original concept documents
3. Ensure all core features from planning docs are addressed
